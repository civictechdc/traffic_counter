#DIY Traffic Counter

This is a simple traffic counter using an Arduino and differential pressure sensor that is being adapted for [Code for DC](http://www.codefordc.org). This is a fork of a [project originally developed by Tomorrow Lab in NYC 2012 (v5)](http://tomorrow-lab.com/ traffic_counter_software.zip). Originally written by Ted Ullricis_measuringh <ted@tomorrow-lab.com>. See more information about [Tomorrow Lab](http://tomorrow-lab.com) and what happened with this initial project at [WayCount](http://waycount.com). Basically Tomorrow Lab is awesome.
